    "A central theme in applied linear algebra is the study of systems of linear algebraic equations. The associated matrix of coefficients is a linear operator between vector spaces. The linear algebra of matrices produces a number of practical results for the solution of linear algebraic equations. It is often the case in applications that the sytems are of several types: a) *overdetermined*, b) *undertermined*, or c) *exactly determined*. Where a) and c) are very common in engineering applications.\n",

    "Practical methods for the solution of $\\overset{(m\\times n)}{\\Amtrx}\\,\\overset{(n)}{\\xvec} = \\overset{(m)}{\\bvec}$ should also be known for reasonable sized systems. Solution methods are typically classified as: a) *direct solution* (involving some sort of factorization) or b) *iterative solution* (involving some sort of preconditioning and accelerator).\n",
    "\n",
    "A practical concept in matrix analysis is the computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors also referred to as principal directions or normal modes. Here eigenvalues can be real or complex numbers. A significant application emerges in the area of linear stability analysis and frequency response.\n",

    "In addition, the generalized linear least-squares method is tightly connected to numerical linear algebra and has ample use in various fields of science and engineering. Here one approach to minimize the leas-squares residual is to solve a linear system known as the normal equations. Other linear algebra approaches to minimize the residual is to perform an orthogonal factorization.\n",

    "The primary use of non-linear algebra is for the (numerical) solution of system of non-linear algebraic equations (root finding). This is typically done via some sort of linearization, say, Newton's method or a variant of it. The linearization results in an iterative algorithm that requires the solution of a linear algebraic system at each iteration. The matrix of coefficient is typically the Jacobian matrix or a modification of it. Sometimes the Jacobian is assembled numerically via simple finite differences. The results of linear algebra apply to any linear system including the Jacobian system. Hence, computational non-linear and linear algebra are interwoven.\n",

    "Systems of ordinary differential equations (ODE) are pervasive in engineering (applied science). The methods of linear algebra and non-linear algebra are the foundations of the computational methods aimed at solving system of ODEs; both linear and non-linear ODEs respectively. Therefore linear and non-linear algebra are stepping stones to the solution of ODEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The immediate goal of ODEs solution methods is to integrate a system of equations with respect to the single independent variable (either time, space, or some other variable).\n",
    "Methods for computational solution of ODEs are broadly classified in explicit and implicity. Explicit methods are less computationally intensive but less accurate, and implicit methods are computationaly intensive but more accurate. Implicit methods typically employ a predictor-corrector algorithm; there are many implementation of this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "ODEs can be of first, second, or third order. Higher than third order ODEs are not common in engineering. Second and higher order ODEs can have boundary conditions at both boundaries of the independent variable interval, therefore marching algorithms need to correct for the boundary condition at the end of the interval (shooting method).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very common for ODEs to be constrained by (linear or non-linear) algebraic equations. For example, conditions based on thermodynamic equilibrium in a otherwise non-equilibrium model, appear as algebraic constraints. In this case, a mix of differential and algebraic equations emerges. Methods for solution of this sort of equations are known as DAE (differential-algebraic equations) solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second goal is to estimate parameter values by minimizing the error of the solution of the ODEs with respect to experimental data. Here a combination of the ODEs solution method and least-squres method is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, the study of the (linear, non-linear) stability of ODEs, in particular those that are dissipative, is a central topic in dynamical systems of interest in many fields. Here steady-state solutions do stay constant if the system is unstable. This can be verified by direct time integration of the ODEs. This has close relation to chaos in dynamical systems.\n",
